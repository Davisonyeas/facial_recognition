# Facial Recognition System

Facial recognition systems are automated technologies that can identify or verify a person's identity using their facial features. These systems use algorithms and machine learning to analyze and compare facial images with a database of known faces to determine if there is a match.

## Advantages

This solution provides the following:

- Face recognition accuracy 99.38% 
- Ability to identify multiple people at once in real time based on one or more reference images.
- Ability to track and assign a unique identifier to each person in the camera image or video. 
- Ability to return a similarity measured between detected faces and reference faces.
## Business Case
‚Äã
Can be used in access control systems or Online Proctoring systems for student authentication or bank authentication
## Technical details 

**Input 1 (video or image to process, capable of processing):** ‚Äã‚Äã

- mjpeg stream

- rtsp stream

- USB camera devices

- video files (avi, mp4, mkv formats supported)

- standalone image files (.png, .jpg formats supported)

 

**Input 2:**

Reference images to which the system compares the faces in the image. (.png, .jpg formats supported)


**Outputs:**

- Processed video frame

- The faces in the frame (bounding boxes)

**For each face:**

- Unique Tracking ID (when processing a video file, the same ID on each frame belongs to the same person)

- The most similar reference face ID

- Degree of similarity to the reference face

- Up to 5 facial landmark points

- The system is able to to write the processed video to a video file. 
## Used By
